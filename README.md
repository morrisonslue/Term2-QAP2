Problems 1-10: Programming With JavaScript - QAP2

Assessment Problems:

1. 1 hour per problem approx but longer for some of the problems I had problems with
2. Lectures, Google (mostly stackoverflow). 
I asked ChatGPT for help for a few areas where I was stuck but asked for GUIDANCE and to not just give me the answer.
I found this extremely helpful and have in the past as well with trying to get better at coding - it was like having a personal tutor
3. N/a
4. N/a
5. I took my time with this assignment and really wanted to make sure I understood what I was doing with js up to this point. 
I found it pretty difficult but feel like I learned a lot from working through the questions. I feel much more confident in my js after having gone through the problems
